# Poll-Application
Developed a basic poll application using Django, allowing users to view polls, cast votes, and see results. The application includes an admin panel for managing polls (adding, editing, and deleting questions and choices). Implemented SQLite3 as the database and used Django's built-in authentication for admin access.
